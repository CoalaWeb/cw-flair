**CoalaWeb Flair** is a Joomla 2.5 and 3.+ extension that lets you display your flair from several StackExchange sites individually or combined into one. You can choose which StackExchanges accounts to display and from one of four style variations for each of them.

★★ Please Note: The StackExchange flair system feeds in a pre created image with a width 208px and a height of 58px so your module position will need sufficient space to accommodate images of this size. ★★

★★ Also Note: Only sites where you have more than 200 reputation will appear in the combined layout. ★★
